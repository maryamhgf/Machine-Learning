# Machine-Learning
Implementation of KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Random Forest, and Hard-Voting using scikit-learn. 
These classifiers predict if a customer would return to the store or not. The training dataset and validation dataset included the date, purchase count, country, quantity of products, and number of product types. I preprocessed non-numeric data with one-hot encoding and label encoding for compression between two methods. Also, the goal of this project is to see advantages and disadvantages of each Machine Learning method.
By running the "InformationGain.py" file, the information gain of each feature and a bar plot woud be shown.
