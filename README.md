# Machine-Learning
In this project, I Implemented several classification methods including KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Random Forest, and Hard-Voting using scikit-learn. The task of the classifiers is to predict whether a customer would return to the store or not. The training dataset and validation dataset included the date, purchase count, country, quantity of products, and number of product types. I preprocessed non-numeric data with one-hot encoding and label encoding and compared the accuracy of each model. Also, the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the generalization is investigated in this project. By running the "InformationGain.py" file, the information gain of each feature and a bar plot would be shown. Therefore, we can understand the impact of each feature to the final result.
